This is an example of how to create some custom tabs, with a highlight effect that follows the mouse cursor.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and I'm also using React Hooks and React Router DOM.

You can visit the GitHub project page [here](https://ioanacosmina.github.io/tabs/) to test the app or just clone the repository.
